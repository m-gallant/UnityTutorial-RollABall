# UnityTutorial RollABall

This project contains the completed game from following Unity's Roll A Ball tutorial.
Note that there are comments in some of the scripts related to reminding myself what the different functions were, as I am using this to learn.

## Acknowledgements

All assets were obtained from downloading the Roll A Ball tutorial package from Unity3d.com, and the game objects and code scripts were created by following
the instructions in the accompanying tutorial videos.
